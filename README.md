# 2048

Hello server.

Ported this [C program](https://github.com/ASSERT-game/2048) to webasm. Used (emcc)[https://emscripten.org/index.html]
to compile it and made a few minor changes as necessary to be able to port.

Used as a small project to learn a bit about the porting process.
Now I can begin a big migration and make my projects visible to all.

But first I need a domain to host these things...
